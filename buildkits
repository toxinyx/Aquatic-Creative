Build Kits are collections of blocks/items that everybody will have access to when building. They could simply be collections of colours,
a palette geared towards a specific era (e.g medieval, modern) or a collection of blocks designed to build a specific thing (e.g machinery
or magic.)

File will be updated as more kits are added.

Currently added kits:
  - Special Blocks
      + Invisible barrier block.
      + Light block.
      + Invisible item frame (normal).
